# ðŸ“¡ Unity Photon Multiplayer Project

This project introduces **Photon Unity Networking (PUN)**, a Unity package for creating multiplayer games. It serves as a foundational step to learn multiplayer and networking concepts using Photon Cloud.

---

## ðŸ§  Learning Objectives

- Explain what Unity PUN is and its benefits.
- Understand the server/client relationship in Photon.
- Create the server-side setup using Photon.
- Implement the client-side setup using Photon.
- Synchronize data between server and clients in Photon.

## ðŸ›  Tasks Overview

### **0. Initialize New Project**
- Create a new Unity project.
- Import the Photon Unity Networking package from the Unity Asset Store.

### **1. Setup the Connection to Photon Cloud**
- Configure the `PhotonServerSettings` in the **Inspector**.
- Set the **App ID** to start using Photon features.

### **2. Create the Player Prefab**
- Import a rigged 3D character.
- Add a movement script to the player.
- Add UI components (name and health bar) above the playerâ€™s head.
- Implement shooting functionality (e.g., spheres as bullets).
- Ensure all elements are synchronized between server and clients.

### **3. Connect to Server (Join a Game)**
- Create a new scene and initialize a connection to the Photon Cloud server.
- Add a **Join Game** button with an InputField for the playerâ€™s name.
- Instantiate the player prefab when a client joins a game.

### **4. Play the Game**
- Allow two or more players to:
  - Move, rotate, and shoot bullets.
  - Synchronize health bars across the server and all clients.
- Implement damage logic so health decreases when a player is hit.

### **5. Kick Out**
- Players with `Health == 0` are kicked out of the game and redirected to the main menu.
- Display a "You Win!" message for the last player standing.
